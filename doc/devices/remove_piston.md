anyloop:remove_piston
=====================

Types and units: `[T_MATRIX, U_ANY] -> [T_UNCHANGED, U_UNCHANGED]`.

This device subtracts the average value in the pipeline matrix from the pipeline
matrix. Useful for e.g. when you want to send a phase front to a deformable
mirror without overwhelming its stroke.
